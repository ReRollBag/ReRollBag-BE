# ReRollBag Server

The "ReRollBag" project is an Android application aimed at promoting sustainable consumption by encouraging the use of
reusable bags instead of plastic bags.

This readme.md is for the backend server application for the ReRollBag project. Also, this is for **Google Solution
Challenge**, topics with **Responsible Consumption & Production.**

The server is developed using SpringBoot with Java and incorporates various technologies such as Test Driven
Development, Spring REST Docs, Spring Data Jpa, Spring Security, JUnit5, AssertJ, and databases including RDBMS (MySQL,
H2) and NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB). This application is also hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.
